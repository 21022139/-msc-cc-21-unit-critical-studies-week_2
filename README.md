###### What having read Haraway ́s Cyborg manifesto teaches us about reading writing


Before I started reading Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto, I came to the text with my old reading mentality, but about halfway through the first chapter, I realized I was wrong. There are too many metaphors and terms here that are outside my limited knowledge. For example, she compares us in the late twentieth century to chimeras, a term I didn't know, a monster from Greek mythology. There is also the capitalized form of "Apocalypse", the title of a chapter in the Book of Revelation. Then I realized that the language barrier might have prevented me from understanding the text and I found a Chinese translation of the Cyborg Manifesto, but even then, I was still confused and didn't understand the text. So, I think that increasing my reading and expanding knowledge and awareness will help me to understand the texts I may read in the future, and it will also allow me to draw my conclusions from my own perspective, considering the content of the texts. This will also help me in my writing, as I will have more ideas to express my views and more articles and references to support my arguments when I have mastered a certain amount of reading.


I really like this quote from the Cyborg manifesto “Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert”. Ten or fifteen years ago, when machines and technology were not so advanced, there was always something to talk about or a wide variety of activities to do when friends got together or had a party, but nowadays, people are looking down at their phones and behaving in a deadly manner.
